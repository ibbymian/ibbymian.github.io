            <p class="apple">The perception of Battery Park is that its residents live in a simulation, a repetitive cycle of work followed by more work. They live with the contemplation that life circulates around a 6-by-2-inch dollar bill; they believe in the ideology that life strictly exists within a 10-square-foot office space, a prison that people voluntarily choose to cage themselves in for hours on end every day. The concept of sleep only exists in their dreams, and the struggle has a hefty price tag. The people of Battery Park live where water from the deli costs a mortgage. Century 21 is a shameful place to shop. Lights in designer stores’ blind sleep-deprived eyes. It is impossible to live in Battery Park, but then again, who would want to? To live in a place corrupted by individualism, without a community. Where everyone is always focused on making it to work on time, who would want to live there? To walk through Battery Park is overwhelming. People are glued to their phones, unable to remove their fixated gaze. The stereotypes Battery Park faces couldn't be more erroneous. </p>
            <p class="apple">What is Battery Park? The reality behind the bougie NYC enclave is indisputable. The aroma of the restaurants on the Hudson River fills one’s nose, creating an endless sense of hunger. The craving can fortunately be easily satisfied at high-end eateries as well as the many kiosks. Battery Park is an escape from the consistent scent of weed NYC supplies. It provides an alternative reality, a portal into a land that doesn’t match its surroundings. The sound of a thousand conversations is not composed of business calls and screaming but instead of laughter and gossip. In Battery Park, people are active. The kids are playing together on one of a dozen basketball courts, at the Rockefeller playground, or on one of the many perfectly green turf fields. People can not escape being people, even with their ludicrous work hours. To look upwards in Battery Park is to see a continued sensation of high-rise buildings where NYC builds its economic reputation. Then the sun starts to set, and the spectacular sunset astounds the eyes - the sky in colors from an infinite palette painted behind the Jersey skyline. As nighttime approaches, the light doesn’t disappear. The LEDs on the Freedom Tower illuminate the West Side highway with a light show every night. The tall buildings look down on the people, laughing at their fascination with sheer steel and glass. </p>
            <p class="apple">The buildings of Battery Park aren’t just offices and residences to be admired, but they also provide a boundary. A boundary that anyone can enter to escape the overwhelming city. The city is hectic, an endless black hole of reality that swallows people whole every day. Battery Park allows people to escape that reality. However, it is not a place of protection. Although it may be one of the safest neighborhoods in the city, Battery Park doesn’t protect someone from NYC. It is not a wall dividing the city from the overwhelmingness of it all, from the struggles one faces every day. The beautiful sunset view only allows someone to temporarily forget the unpaid rent, the meeting with the boss, and the college application. What is on the left of the West Side Highway is not reality, neither is it NYC. The place of four-dollar water bottles and three a.m. walks with both AirPods on blast doesn’t accurately describe what life in the city is. Battery Park is not New York, but New York is not New York without Battery Park.</p>
            <p class="apple">Just as there can not be New York without Chelsea, just as it will be incomplete without the East Village or Times Square, without the energy, people, and the beautiful buildings and monuments of Battery Park, New York would be emptier. Although it does create an ego for those who reside there, Battery Park exudes a sense of importance and a feeling of reliability. New York is not just one place, one definite thing, an absolute answer. New York is a spectacle, the place of everything; it is a place to walk down the street and see a million different types of stores. A New York without Battery Park simply would not be New York.</p>
